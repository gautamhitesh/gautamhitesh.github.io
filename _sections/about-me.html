<p>Currently doing a 10 hour desk job in Bengaluru, fighting bugs (some of my own creation), developing softwares (not really) with keystrokes (my favorite Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V) and the curious neurons simultaneously firing like a Metal Storm gun in my brain.</p> 
<p>I can write more about me but.. we create a unique image in the mind of the person we interact with...(that in turn depends on the time, situation).
    So, feel free to fit any personality on me but keep in mind: 
</p>
<p>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.... :)</p>
