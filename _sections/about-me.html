<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="assets/images/img_sunset_tari.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>Currently doing a 10 hour desk jobx, fighting bugs (some of my own creation), developing softwares (not really) with keystrokes (my favorite Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V) and the curious neurons simultaneously firing like a Metal Storm gun in my brain.</p> 

<p>The picture of view of Galaxy on the top induces the desire in me to explore. 
    The Profile image has the symbol of Blue Lantern depicting HOPE and it is the strongest of all the Lanterns (DC Universe). 
    I like sunrise and sunsets, nature in its original form and I am desperately waiting for my first DSLR.</p>

<p>I can write more about me but.. we create a unique image in the mind of the person we interact with...(that in turn depends on the time, situation).
    So, feel free to fit any personality on me but keep in mind: 
</p>
<p>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.... :)</p>
