1. Knowledge Sharing:
  * Medium: Elaborated topics minimum 10 minute read (but are worth it).
  * Quora: Question specific knowledge, helps in understanding different views (5-10 minutes must per day).
2. Note taking: Microsoft OneNote (Notebook --> Sections --> Pages), complex than Evernote but fancy and handy to use.
